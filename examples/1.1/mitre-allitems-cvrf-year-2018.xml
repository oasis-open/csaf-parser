<Title>CVE-2018-0103</Title>
<Notes><Note Type="Description" Ordinal="1">A Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player
for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code on the system of a user. The attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending the user a link or email
attachment with a malicious ARF file and persuading the user to follow
the link or launch the file. Successful exploitation could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user&apos;s system. This
vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco
WebEx Meetings sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx ARF
players. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg78835, CSCvg78837, CSCvg78839.

<Title>CVE-2018-0114</Title>
<Notes><Note Type="Description" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before
0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign
tokens using a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability
is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key
(JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a
JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker
could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the
original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then
signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated
with the public key embedded in that JWS header.
