        Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Routers and Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit 
        Security Routers have several web interface vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a 
        remote, unauthenticated user. Cisco has released free software updates that address 
        these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

            The Cisco RVS4000 and WRVS4400N Gigabit Security Routers deliver high-speed network 
            access and IPsec VPN capabilities for small businesses. They also provides firewall 
            and intrusion prevention capabilities.
            The Cisco RVS4000 and WRVS4400N Gigabit Security Routers contains a web management 
            interface vulnerability:
            Retrieval of the configuration file
            If an administrator of the device has previously created a backup of the
            configuration, using Administration --> Backup &amp; Restore --> Backup, it is 
            possible for a remote unauthenticated user to access the backup configuration file.
            This file contains all configuration parameters of the device, including the HTTP
            authentication password and VPN pre-shared-keys (PSKs).

                Disable remote management:
                    Caution: Do not disable remote management if you manage the device via the WAN
                    connection. Doing so will result in loss of management connectivity to the device.
                    Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can
                    disable it using the Firewall > Basic Settings screen. Change the setting for
                    the field "Remote Management" to "Disabled".
                    Disabling remote management limits the exposure of the vulnerabilities to those
                    on the local LAN.
                Limit remote management access to specific IP addresses:
                    If remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed
                    only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of "any". By
                    entering the configuration screen at Firewall --> Basic Settings, an
                    administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with

                Disable remote management:
                    Caution: Do not disable remote management if you manage the device via the WAN
                    connection. Doing so will result in loss of management connectivity to the device.
                    Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can
                    disable it using the Firewall > Basic Settings screen. Change the setting for
                    the field "Remote Management" to "Disabled".
                    Disabling remote management limits the exposure of the vulnerabilities to those
                    on the local LAN.
                Limit remote management access to specific IP addresses:
                    If remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed
                    only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of "any". By
                    entering the configuration screen at Firewall --> Basic Settings, an
                    administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with
                    the specified IP addresses can access the device.

                Disable remote management:
                    Caution: Do not disable remote management if you manage the device via the WAN
                    connection. Doing so will result in loss of management connectivity to the device.
                    Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can
                    disable it using the Firewall > Basic Settings screen. Change the setting for
                    the field "Remote Management" to "Disabled".
                    Disabling remote management limits the exposure of the vulnerabilities to those
                    on the local LAN.
                Limit remote management access to specific IP addresses:
                    If remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed
                    only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of "any". By
                    entering the configuration screen at Firewall --> Basic Settings, an
                    administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with
                    the specified IP addresses can access the device.
